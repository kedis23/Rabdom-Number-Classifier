# Rabdom-Number-Classifier

The above code is a class called RandomNumberClassifier that can be used to generate random numbers and classify them into different categories based on their value. The class has five attributes, cat1, cat2, cat3, cat4, and cat5, which represent the different categories of numbers. The cat1 attribute holds the numbers that fall into the first category (numbers between 1 and 20), cat2 holds the numbers that fall into the second category (numbers between 21 and 40), cat3 holds the numbers that fall into the third category (numbers between 41 and 60), cat4 holds the numbers that fall into the fourth category (numbers between 61 and 80), and cat5 holds the numbers that fall into the fifth category (numbers between 81 and 100).

The __init__ method is the constructor method for the class, which is called when a new object of the class is created. This method takes an optional parameter called nums, which is a list of lists that contain the numbers to be classified into the different categories. If no nums parameter is provided, the method initializes the cat1, cat2, cat3, cat4, and cat5 attributes with empty lists.

The print method is used to print out the numbers in each category and the total number of numbers in each category. This method prints out the values of the cat1, cat2, cat3, cat4, and cat5 attributes, along with the length of each of these attributes (which represents the total number of numbers in each category).

The rand_gen method is used to generate the random numbers and classify them into the different categories based on their value. This method uses the randint function from the random module to generate the random numbers. The randint function takes two parameters, a lower bound and an upper bound, and returns a random integer between the lower and upper bounds (including the bounds themselves). In this case, the randint function is called with the lower bound set to 1 and the upper bound set to 100, so it generates random integers between 1 and 100.

The rand_gen method then loops through the generated random numbers and classifies them into the different categories based on their value. If the value of a number is less than or equal to 20, it is added to the cat1 list, if it is between 21 and 40, it is added to the cat2 list, and so on. At the end of the loop, the rand_gen method returns the list of lists containing the classified numbers.

The get_amount method is used to prompt the user to enter the amount of random numbers to generate. This method uses a while loop to keep asking the user for an amount until a valid value is entered. The entered value must be a number that is less than or equal to 100, otherwise an error message is displayed and the user is asked to try again. Once a valid value is entered, the method returns this value.

In the if __name__ == '__main__' block, the rand_gen method is called to generate the random numbers. These numbers are then passed as a parameter to the RandomNumberClassifier constructor to create a new object of the class. The print method is then called on this object to print out the classified numbers and their counts.
